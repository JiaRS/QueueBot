# QueueBot
RS3 Queue Bot - used to process requests

This discord bot is used to process queue requests such as leech/trial requests and provides assistance.

Credit to Jia for writing the base for this thing, and I guess credits to me for memeing because I'm lazy af.  
More credits to be added for my bot Jia as neccessary.

TO USE:
Navigate to your folder and type in "npm install" on your terminal.  This installs all the required packages.

You will also need to write your own wrapper class that will contain information such as your bot token and email authentication.
When done, just simply call 'node wrapper.js' (There are additional parameters that you can add at the end such as -debug)
